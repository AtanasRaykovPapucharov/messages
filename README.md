# messages
Express API + React Client Task

## Task conditions
Please create a web app using NodeJS and React where the user can input a message from a textarea and save it in a MongoDB. There should be a view where all messages are listed and you can see 2 buttons for each existing entry - edit and delete, and on top there should be an Add button, allowing you to add a new message.

- Build it as a REST service.
- Use Mocha/Jest to cover your code with tests.
- Don't bother with the optical design at all. (NOTE: Well, please excuse me, but I get a little css. If you don't like it, just ignore it).

## Start up
- **npm i** - install dependencies

- **npm start** - start server

- **npm run react** - run react client

- **npm test** - run tests
